## Project Description
This project was designed to help me learn how to create a CRUD back-end application for a website using Object-Relational Mapping. I used the starting expressjs API code and used sequelize to connect it to the database. Then, using different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE), I was able to create, read, update, or delete data from the database.
